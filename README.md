Conclusion:

The analysis concludes that there is a potential correlation between economic factors and suicide rates. Specifically, the data suggests that suicide rates are influenced by variables such as GDP per capita, unemployment rates, and inflation rates. The findings show a statistically significant difference in suicide rates across various GDP per capita categories, indicating that wealth disparity may be associated with differing suicide rates, even though the visual differences in the data appear small.

The relationship between inflation and suicide rates is weak but statistically significant, implying that inflation alone is not a strong predictor of suicide rates. Moreover, the analysis reveals that unemployment rates have little to no impact on suicide rates.

The findings also provide demographic insights, showing that suicide rates peak in middle age, particularly in the 35-54 age group, and that there is a pronounced gender disparity, with men being at a higher risk of suicide compared to women.

In conclusion, while the relationships between economic factors and suicide rates are complex and influenced by various variables, the statistical analysis highlights the importance of addressing mental health and well-being, especially during periods of economic instability. The results also emphasize the need for targeted mental health support for middle-aged individuals and men, who are shown to be at higher risk.
